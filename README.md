## ABOUT HOMIFY
Homify is built using a modular approach so support for other devices or actions can be implemented easily. See also the section on creating your own plug-in below in this READ.me.

## KEY FEATURES

* Manage your IoT-devices simply over the GUI
  - Instantly see if your device is online or not
* Automate your home with rules
* Install Plug-ins
  - Homify is built using a modular approach so support for other devices or actions can be implemented easily.
* Central Room Management
* Tablet View for your rooms

## FEATURED PLUG-INS

- <a href="https://github.com/markushaug/homify-sonos">```Sonos Plug-in```</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/markushaug/homify-rfoutlet">```RFOutlet (433 Mhz) Plug-in ```</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/markushaug/homify-phue">```Hue Plug-in```</a>

## SETUP
To install and run this application, you'll need <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> and PHP7 installed on your computer. 

### Composer
```bash
# Download & install Homify with its dependencies
$ composer create-project markushaug/homify
$ composer update
```

### Database
Setup your database & mail settings in the ```.env``` file and then run:

```bash
# Creating tables and inserting their default values to them
$ php artisan migrate
$ php artisan db:seed
```

### Webserver
- Set the webroot of your webserver to the ```public``` folder
- Grant permissions to the homify folder. 
  - If the application runs into an issue, try this command inside of the homify directory: ```chmod -R 777 storage```.

### Note for Raspberry Pi users
I highly recommend to use nginx or lighttp. Apache2 is using too much CPU and RAM on the Raspberry PI.


## RULES
Homify supports rules to automate your home. You can create a rule via Homifys web interface.

### Features
- Define multiple rules for one thing.<br>
  Each rule expands the entire rule base of the respective item with a logical OR.<br>
  ```IF <RULE1> === TRUE || <RULE2> === TRUE || ...```<br>
- The ```ThingController``` calls the RuleParser every time an event is triggered and scans for defined rules in the rule base.
- Time-controlled events are constructed as a cron job that triggers the execution block. ( Not yet implemented )

### Structure
Each Rule has the following structure:
```
{
	"rule": "rule name (unique)",
	"if": {
        /*<TRIGGER CONDITION>*/
	},
	"then": {
        /*
        <EXECUTION_BLOCK1>
        */
	}
}
```
### Example
Below is an example of a rule with a time-controlled event wich triggers a channel of the defined thing.
```json
{
	"rule": "goodEvening",
	"if": {
		"time": "20:00:00"
	},
	"then": {
		"thing": {
			"name": "Play1",
			"channel": "off"
		}
	}
}
```

## HTTP-API
Homify provides a http-api to acces your things.
You can use the following HTTP-GET Request to access your things:

- ```https://<server_ip>/thing/<thing_name>/<channel>```

For example:
- ```https://10.10.3.1/thing/Sonos:Play1/on``` 

## COMING SOON
- WebGUI for central room management & device management
- Tablet View for single rooms
- HAP-Protocol (HomeKit) integration
- Cron-Jobs for Time-triggered rules

## PLUG-IN DEVELOPMENT
Each Plug-in inherits from a Thing-Type (```Light```, ```Switch```, ```Speaker```, etc.). Each Thing-Type inherits from the abstract thing class. So each thing has the required functions.

If you are creating a plug-in for homify, you have to inherit from a Thing-Type. Or you create an additional thing-type.
Each Thing needs a ```<Thing>.php```, ```Create<Thing>.php``` and a ```Update<Thing>.php``` File. You can take on of the existing Plug-ins as template.
